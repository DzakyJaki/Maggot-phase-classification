# 🐛 Maggot Phase Classification Model

This repository contains a deep learning-based solution for classifying maggots into various growth stages using TensorFlow and Keras. The application aims to assist maggot farmers in identifying and categorizing maggots based on images captured through a camera.

## 🌟 Features
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Identify six maggot growth stages:
  1. `larva_tahap_1`
  2. `larva_tahap_2`
  3. `larva_tahap_3`
  4. `maggot`
  5. `prapupa`
  6. `pupa`
- **Image Augmentation**: Enhanced generalization with data augmentation.
- **Pre-Trained Model Support**: Compatible with transfer learning for higher accuracy.

## 🗂️ Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images for each maggot growth stage.
